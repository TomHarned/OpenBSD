The openBSD package install on it's own isn't very good.

...but you can use it to bootstrap the compiler and install go from source.

doas pkg_add go

# download the source

gunzip source_code.tar.gz

tar xf source_code.tar

# Move the go/ directory to $HOME/.local 
mv ~/go ~/.local/
cd go

# Follow the build from source instructions

# Set GOPATH and GOROOT
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOROOT=$HOME/.local/go

# Make sure the go compiler is in your path
export PATH=$PATH:/home/theuser/.local/go/bin

# Install gopls for lsp goodies
go get golang.org/x/tools/gopls
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest.
